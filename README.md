# Dark-and-Light
Game involving lights and physics.

Dark and Light is a light-based game that is quite simple to operate. The player controls one small green ball that can move in 
any direction. Because the game takes place in complete darkness, the player can also switch on and off a green flash light. However, 
the player does not only have to contend with darkness alone, he is also antagonized by numerous enemies, who use different shades of light to injure the player. Navigating through 
the darkness, the player must reach the end of the level safely, solving puzzles and dodging enemies along the way. 

The game can only be played through the use of a computer (either mac or PC), and is run through a java jar. Both a keyboard 
and a mouse are necessary to play this game. Language-wise, the game is written solely in java, and utilizes the Libgdx engine, as 
well as the box2d and box2dlight extensions. The programming behind the game consists mainly of math, in the areas of both physics 
and geometry. Despite this, the game only requries an elementary understanding of math to comprehend, and the code itself is 
not terribly difficult to comprehend. 

The basic controls of the game are as follows: WASD keys for movement and a mouse for rotating the flashlight and turning it on/off.
